# CARLANET

## Description

CarlaNet is a private project developed to facilitate research and development in the field of autonomous driving using deep learning methodologies. This project harnesses the power of the CARLA simulator, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. The project is part of a larger effort, a Bachelor Thesis on implementing deep learning techniques on autonomous vehicles.

Our goal with CarlaNet is to provide a structured, flexible, and easy-to-use platform for defining, training, and evaluating deep learning models in the context of autonomous driving. The project involves various stages, from sensor data acquisition and pre-processing in the CARLA environment, to the implementation of deep learning algorithms for tasks such as perception, localization, and control.

## Installation

To set up the necessary environment for this project:

1. Install CARLA. Instructions for installing CARLA can be found [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/).

2. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/<username>/carlanet.git
cd carlanet
```

3. Install the project along with its dependencies using the provided setup script.

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

CarlaNet is designed to be flexible and user-friendly. It includes a variety of scripts for data handling, model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization. Specific usage instructions and examples will be provided in the corresponding script documentation.

## Contributing
